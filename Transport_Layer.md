# Transport Layer

### 1. Transport services and protocols  

*   **provide** **logical communication** **between** **processes running on different hosts**  

*   transport protocols run in end systems
    *   send side: **breaks** application **messages** into **segments**, passes down to **network layer**
    *   receiving side: **reassembles** segments into messages, passes up to **application layer**  

*   more than one transport protocol available to apps
    Internet: **`TCP`** and **`UDP`**  

    

#### 1.1 Transport vs. network layer  

The transport layer lies just above the network layer in the protocol stack.
